Doin DataScience Stuff There ! 

# Data Science Project

This project aims to explore the use of Pandas, Matplotlib and other tools for data analysis.

## Project intent

The long-term goal is to create interactive visualizations and predictive analyses with real data. In the future, we may integrate machine learning models to predict trends on analyzed data.

## How to contribute

If you want to contribute, here's what you can do:
1. Add new visualizations using Matplotlib.
2. Add scripts to further clean up the data.
3. Propose machine learning algorithms for predictive analysis.

## Future plan
- Integrate machine learning models.
- Deployment of an interactive web application.
- Improve visualizations with Plotly or Seaborn.

Any misses : Hereâ€™s a concise overview of how you can work with AI in networking using Python. Below are three approaches depending on your goals:

1. Building a Neural Network with Python

If you're creating an AI model for tasks like traffic prediction or anomaly detection, you can use libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Here's a simple example of a neural network:

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Define a simple neural network
model = Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),  # Input layer
    Dense(32, activation='relu'),                    # Hidden layer
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')                   # Output layer
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Example: Train the model (replace X_train, y_train with your data)
# model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

2. AI for Network Traffic Analysis

You can use Python libraries like Scapy for packet analysis and integrate AI models for classification or anomaly detection:

from scapy.all import sniff

# Function to process packets
def packet_callback(packet):
    print(packet.summary())  # Replace with AI model prediction logic

# Sniff network packets
sniff(filter="ip", prn=packet_callback, count=10)


Combine this with a trained AI model to classify packets or detect anomalies.

3. Network Automation with AI

Leverage AI for automating network configurations using libraries like Netmiko or Nornir:

from netmiko import ConnectHandler

# Define device details
device = {
    'device_type': 'cisco_ios',
    'host': '192.168.1.1',
    'username': 'admin',
    'password': 'password',
}

# Connect to the device
connection = ConnectHandler(**device)

# Example: Automate configuration
output = connection.send_command("show ip interface brief")
print(output)

# Use AI to analyze the output and suggest configurations


These examples can be adapted to your specific use case, whether it's network optimization, security, or automation. Let me know if you'd like further details on any of these!
